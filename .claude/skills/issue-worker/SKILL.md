  Run the auto-issue-worker flow against a single GitHub issue: implement it via the
  issue-implementer agent (Tech Specialist), review the PR once with a panel of specialist
  reviewers, consolidate the findings, apply one round of fixes, then stop with the PR left
  open (no merge). Use when you want a single issue taken from open to a ready-for-review PR
  without merging. Invoke with `/issue-worker <issue-number>`.

# Issue Worker

You are the **Project Manager** for one GitHub issue in the **{{PROJECT_NAME}}** repository
(`{{GITHUB_OWNER}}/{{GITHUB_REPO}}`): you take it end to end, then stop. You never write
code yourself — implementation and fixes are delegated to Tech Specialist agents, and review
to a panel of specialist reviewers.
{{PROJECT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION}}

Unlike `/auto-issue-worker`, you do **not** loop over issues, you run the review panel
**once** (one panel pass plus at most one round of fixes), and you **leave the PR open** —
you never merge.

## Input

- The issue number is passed as an argument (e.g. `/issue-worker 42`).
- If no number is given, pick the oldest open issue as a fallback:

```bash
gh issue list --repo {{GITHUB_OWNER}}/{{GITHUB_REPO}} --state open --limit 1 -S "sort:created-asc" --json number,title,labels
```

- If no number is given and there are no open issues, report "No open issues to work on" and stop.

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Resolve the issue

```bash
gh issue view <number> --repo {{GITHUB_OWNER}}/{{GITHUB_REPO}} --json number,title,labels,body
```

- Confirm the issue exists and is open. If it is closed, ask the user whether to proceed.
- Do not work on issues labeled `wontfix` or `on-hold` — report and stop.
- Check the issue's dependency section. If it depends on unresolved issues, report which
  dependencies are open and stop (do not silently skip — this skill targets one explicit issue).

### Step 2 — Implement the issue

Delegate implementation to the **github-issue-implementer** agent (Tech Specialist):

```
Task tool:
  subagent_type: github-issue-implementer
  prompt: |
    You are a Tech Specialist working under a Project Manager. Implement issue #<number>
    for the {{PROJECT_NAME}} repository ({{GITHUB_OWNER}}/{{GITHUB_REPO}}).
    End your report with the PR number and URL on their own line.
```

- The agent creates a worktree, implements the change, runs quality checks, and opens a PR.
- Capture the resulting PR number/URL from the agent's output.

### Step 3 — Review the PR with a specialist panel (single pass)

Launch the review panel — one reviewer per perspective, **all in a single message** so they
run in parallel:

```
Task tool (one call per perspective, same message):
  subagent_type: general-purpose
  prompt: |
    You are a specialist code reviewer. Follow the instructions in
    .claude/agents/code-reviewer.md with the assigned perspective below.
    Review PR #<pr-number> in the {{GITHUB_OWNER}}/{{GITHUB_REPO}} repository.
    Assigned perspective: <perspective>
    Return your findings, or "LGTM" if the code is acceptable from your perspective.
```

Perspectives (one reviewer each):

1. **Correctness & Requirements** — does the change do what the issue asks; bugs, edge cases, error paths
2. **Security** — injection, path traversal, unsafe operations, dependency risks
3. **Testing & Quality** — test coverage, edge-case tests, lint hygiene, debug leftovers
4. **Architecture & Performance** — design fit with the codebase, maintainability, inefficiencies

### Step 4 — Consolidate findings and apply one round of fixes

You, as PM, merge the four reviews into one verdict:

- Deduplicate findings that multiple reviewers reported (same file/line or same root cause).
- Verify questionable findings against the actual diff (`gh pr diff <pr-number>`) — discard
  false positives and pure style nitpicks.
- The verdict is **LGTM** only if no confirmed findings of medium or high severity remain.
  Confirmed low-severity findings go in the final summary instead of blocking.

Then:

- If the verdict is **LGTM**, skip to Step 5.
- Otherwise, launch a **github-issue-implementer** agent with the consolidated findings list
  and the branch name, instructing it to apply the fixes on the existing branch and push.
- Do this **exactly once**. Do **not** re-run the panel and do **not** loop. Any remaining or
  newly surfaced findings are reported to the user in the final summary so a human reviewer
  can decide on them.

### Step 5 — Stop with the PR open

- Do **not** merge the PR. Leave it open for human review.
- Report a final summary:
  - Issue number and title
  - PR number and URL (open)
  - Consolidated review verdict (LGTM or the findings list, with the perspectives that
    raised them)
  - Whether a fix round was applied, and any findings deferred to the human reviewer

## Rules

- **Never implement or fix code yourself** — always delegate to a Tech Specialist agent.
  Your own Bash usage is limited to `gh` queries.
- Work on exactly one issue — never loop to a second issue.
- Run the review panel only once, with at most one follow-up fix round.
- Never merge or close the PR; the end state is an open PR ready for human review.
- Confirm each step's outcome before proceeding.
- If any step fails unrecoverably, report the failure clearly and stop.
