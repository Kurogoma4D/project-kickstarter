  Read `spec.md`, break it down into discrete implementation tasks, and register them
  as GitHub issues in the project repository. Use after a spec exists (e.g. produced by
  the `spec-builder` skill) and the user wants to turn it into actionable issues.
  Invoke with `/spec-to-issues`. The created issues are consumed by `/auto-issue-worker`.

# Spec to Issues

You turn the project specification into a set of GitHub issues for the
**{{PROJECT_NAME}}** repository (`{{GITHUB_OWNER}}/{{GITHUB_REPO}}`). You read `spec.md`,
decompose it into appropriately-sized tasks, and create one issue per task using the
`gh` CLI. The resulting issues are designed to be picked up by `/auto-issue-worker`.

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Load the spec

- Read `spec.md` from the repository root.
- If it is missing, tell the user to run `/spec-builder` first and stop.
- Confirm you can reach the repo: `gh repo view {{GITHUB_OWNER}}/{{GITHUB_REPO}}`.

### Step 2 — Decompose into tasks

Break the spec into discrete, independently-implementable tasks:

- Each task should be a **single PR-sized unit of work** (roughly a few hours to a day).
- Split large functional requirements into multiple tasks (e.g. data model → API → UI).
- Include non-functional work (tests, CI, docs) as its own tasks where meaningful.
- Identify **dependencies** between tasks (e.g. "API endpoint" depends on "data model").
  `/auto-issue-worker` skips issues whose dependencies are still open, so record them.
- Reference the originating spec section in each task (e.g. "From FR-2").

### Step 3 — Confirm the plan with the user

Before creating any issues, present the proposed task list as a table:

| # | Title | Spec ref | Depends on | Labels |
|---|-------|----------|-----------|--------|

- Ask the user to approve, edit, add, or remove tasks.
- Use `AskUserQuestion` for decisions like granularity or labeling if unclear.
- Do not create issues until the user approves the list.

### Step 4 — Create the issues

For each approved task, create an issue with `gh`:

```bash
gh issue create \
  --repo {{GITHUB_OWNER}}/{{GITHUB_REPO}} \
  --title "<concise task title>" \
  --label "<label>" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
<What this task delivers, in one or two sentences.>

## Context
From: <spec section, e.g. FR-2 / Non-Functional Requirements>

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] <Verifiable outcome>
- [ ] <Verifiable outcome>
- [ ] E2E behavior is verified and guaranteed at the completion of this task

## Dependencies
- <Depends on #<n>, or "None">
EOF
)"
```

Rules for issue creation:

- Create issues in **dependency order** so earlier issues have lower numbers, then edit
  later issues to reference the actual issue numbers of their dependencies (use
  `gh issue edit <n> --body ...` to fill in `#<n>` once known).
- Keep titles imperative and concise (e.g. "Add user authentication endpoint").
- Apply consistent labels (e.g. `feature`, `enhancement`, `chore`, `docs`, `test`).
  Create missing labels with `gh label create` if needed, after confirming with the user.
- The **Dependencies** section is required — `/auto-issue-worker` reads it to decide ordering.
- Every issue's **Acceptance Criteria** must include the item
  "E2E behavior is verified and guaranteed at the completion of this task" as a completion condition.

### Step 5 — Report

- Print a summary table mapping each task to its created issue number/URL.
- Tell the user they can now run `/auto-issue-worker` to implement the issues automatically.

## Rules

- Never create issues before the user approves the task list (Step 3).
- Each issue must be self-contained: a developer (or the issue-implementer agent) should be
  able to implement it from the issue body plus `spec.md` alone.
- Keep the dependency graph acyclic — flag and resolve any circular dependencies with the user.
- Use the same language as `spec.md` for issue titles and bodies.
- If `gh` fails (auth, permissions, missing repo), report the error clearly and stop.
